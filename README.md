# Youtube-and-Text-summerizer
A Streamlit app that extracts transcripts from YouTube videos and uses Google Gemini to generate concise, structured notes. It handles different video links, displays thumbnails, and provides quick summaries for easy learning and revision.
# Overview

The YouTube Transcript to Notes Converter is an AI-powered web application designed to simplify video learning by converting spoken content into concise written notes. The system extracts transcripts from YouTube videos and uses a generative AI model to produce structured summaries, enabling users to quickly grasp key ideas without watching the entire video.

# Objective

The main objective of this project is to improve learning efficiency by transforming long video content into short, readable notes. It helps students, researchers, and professionals save time while revising or understanding concepts presented in video format.

# Working Principle

The user provides a YouTube video link.

The system extracts the video ID and retrieves the transcript using the YouTube Transcript API.

The extracted transcript text is processed and sent to a generative AI model.

The AI model analyzes the content and generates a concise summary highlighting the key points.

The summarized notes are displayed to the user in an easy-to-read format.

# Key Concepts Involved

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Used to understand and summarize textual data.

Generative AI: Produces human-like summaries from transcripts.

API Integration: Enables communication with YouTube and AI services.

Human-Computer Interaction: Provides a simple interface for user input and output visualization.

# Applications

Quick revision of educational lectures

Summarizing webinars and podcasts

Research content extraction

Productivity and knowledge management

# Advantages

Saves time by eliminating the need to watch full videos

Provides structured and readable notes

Simple and user-friendly workflow

Useful for learning, revision, and content analysis

# Limitations

Works only when video transcripts are available

Summary quality depends on transcript accuracy

May miss visual context from the video
